Java-based Calculator application. It provides basic arithmetic operations, Fibonacci sequence calculation, and statistical functions like finding the mode and mean of an array. The project is modular, following clean coding principles with separate classes for input handling and calculations


# Features
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
Division (handles division by zero).

Fibonacci Sequence: Computes the Fibonacci number for a given position.

Statistical Functions: Calculates the mode and mean of an array.

User-Friendly Input: Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

# Functions

Calculator.java


  add(double, double): Returns the sum of two numbers.
  
  subtract(double, double): Returns the difference of two numbers.
  
  multiply(double, double): Returns the product of two numbers.
  
  divide(double, double): Returns the quotient; handles division by zero.
  
  fibonacci(int): Returns the Fibonacci number at a specific position.
  
  findMode(int[]): Returns the most frequent number in an array.
  
  findMean(int[]): Returns the average of an array.


  

UserInput.java
  
  getOperationChoice()`: Captures user's choice of operation.
 
  getNumbers()`: Accepts two numbers from the user.
  
  getFibonacciInput()`: Accepts input for the Fibonacci sequence.
